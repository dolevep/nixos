# unsure how flake.nix really works - but it seems that it comes before the config file - disk config is there.
#
# /static
#
# my system(s? eventually), will have a /static directory, this is basically 'data', a logical, cental 
# point for all mutable data.
# 
# good place for a home directory, no?
# 
# thus: /static/u/niceguy
#   = /static/ (data) -> u/ (users) -> name (name of user)
#
# along the same line of thinking, using btrfs labels, id like to keep my entire system configuration isolated 
# thus /copycat and the copycat user group are made and now we have user level access to make changes
# and only requiring root once we would like to commit / rebuild / switch
#
# in my mind configuration is a bucket containing all the others, but it might be worth tying to reframe
# my thinking to flake contains hardware-configuration and configuration which contains system-configuration / 
# and then becomes either system-configuration is the end point or home-manager or whatever other alternative there 
# might be out there.
# 
# hardware-configuration is already separate from the rest, 
# following convention I make configuration.nix my base
# including some initial user passwords and such
# and following our disko configuration. 
# 
# once used these are largely left untouched/changed unless a physical system rebuild occurs,
# you're spinning up on a new device, or conventions/standards within nix force an update.
#
# that leaves system-configuration.nix which because it has all the others as a 'base' 
# thus we should probably import at the END of our configuration.
#
# this means ultimately our entire system will be 
# 
#	./_origin-version.nix
# ./flake.nix
# ./hardware-configuration.nix    
# ./configuration.nix							<- you're here now
# ./system-configuration.nix
#
#	system-configuration in theory is actually doing some of the work of home-manager, but the beauty of this setup is
# should i want to piece out i only need to adjust the system-configuration and my local home.nix file 
# 
# this level of separation into logical chunks makes it very easy to work with
# the most important thing to be very VERY CAREFUL of is, do not let this balloon, it can be very
# difficult to untether a bunch of interlinking config files - so having this 'plan' to stick to means 
# we hopefully avoid that in the future but still allow for extensibility.
# 
#WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH `./_origin-version.nix` UNLESS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
